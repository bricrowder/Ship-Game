# Space-Game

Fly a ship around a planet and shoot bad guys.

The game rotates around origin of main screen/canvas based on your movement.

Planet is also procedurally generated using the law of cosine.  There can be "zones" on the planet such as city, or forest etc.that make up pie pieces of the planet circle.

Note: for Love 10.x.  It uses 0-255 colour values.
